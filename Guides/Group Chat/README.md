## How to nail group chats on sillytavern?
This Isn't exactly a guide. most of the important stuff are available on other character creation guides, and ST DOCS. But people complaining on group chats not working for them the way they hoped is common, so I thought I'll write a few pointers that if you mind them, it can significantly improve the experience.
I'll be referring to a case of 3 group members in a chat group for simplicity (2 AI characters + a Human player ({{use}}), but mastering
that, makes adding more characters to the group simple because the core concepts remain the same..
so, diving right in, the following approach, should guarantee a better group chat experience:
### SCENARIO:
Try picking random characters for a group chat, with no specified scenarios in any of the character cards. If the characters are interesting, if they have some specified goals or ambitions, you may have a nice experience. the problems begin when those cards include a scenarios, or even if you use the scenario override and write a unified scenario for all characters to use.

### IMPORTANT NOTES:
Scenario:
First of all, if your characters weren't made with group chats in mind, delete all participating characters private scenarios. They'll only confuse the characters when on group chat.
If you use a unified scenario I highly recommend against it. If you insist, stick to the bare minimum, but add a more elaborate scenario on each character's description box (this part is important, it has to be in the description box, because a unified scenario cancels the scenario box of every participating character.
