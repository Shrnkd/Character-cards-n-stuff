## How to nail group chats on sillytavern?
This Isn't exactly a guide. most of the important stuff are available on other character creation guides, and ST DOCS. But people complaining on group chats not working for them the way they hoped is common, so I thought I'll write a few pointers that if you mind them, it can significantly improve the experience.
I'll be referring to a case of 3 group members in a chat group for simplicity (2 AI characters + a Human player ({{user}}), but mastering
that, makes adding more characters to the group simple because the core concepts remain the same..
so, diving right in, the following approach, should guarantee a better group chat experience:
### SCENARIO:
Make sure the characters you pick have no prefilled scenatio. If they do - Delete it. you'll be needing that block.
**Do not use the chat scenario override available in the group setting.** Sure, It solves the issue of having unrelated scenarios specified on each character card - but we already took care of it by deleting those (Or copy pasting them into the creator's notes - if you wish to keep those scenarios for later use).
#### Now comes the important part:
Whatever your scenario is. split it into 2:




### IMPORTANT NOTES:
Scenario:
First of all, if your characters weren't made with group chats in mind, delete all participating characters private scenarios. They'll only confuse the characters when on group chat.
If you use a unified scenario I highly recommend against it. If you insist, stick to the bare minimum, but add a more elaborate scenario on each character's description box (this part is important, it has to be in the description box, because a unified scenario cancels the scenario box of every participating character.
